# Logistic-Regression
The logistic regression model is used to solve classification problems. 
Both the logistic regression model and linear regression model are generalized linear models. 
Logistic regression introduces nonlinear factors (the sigmoid function) based on linear regression and sets thresholds, so it can deal with binary classification problems.
